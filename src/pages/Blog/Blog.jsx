                    <blockquote>
                        Controlled Component managed by React state, parent component updates state on user interaction, data flows from parent component to component, easier to debug, generally faster as there's less state management, less complex code. Whereas, Uncontrolled Component managed by component's own internal state,component updates own internal state on user interaction, data flows within the component, more difficult to debug, generally slower as there's more state management, considered an alternate approach.

                    <blockquote>
                        App.propTypes is used for props validation. If some of the props aren't using the correct type that we assigned, we will get a console warning. Specifying validation patterns is followed by setting App.defaultProps. For performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode.
                        To install the prop-types library, we run:
                        npm i prop-types
